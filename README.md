# Java JDBC Project

This project was developed as part of my studies in Java Database Connectivity (JDBC).  
It will demonstrate a complete CRUD implementation using Java and MySQL, following clean architecture principles.

# Project Goals

- Practice JDBC database connection
- Implement full CRUD operations
- Apply layered architecture (Repository + Service)
- Use PreparedStatement safely
- Handle SQL exceptions properly
- Organize code following SOLID principles

# --- Technologies Used ---

- Java 17+
- JDBC
- MySQL
- Git & GitHub

# --- Project Structure ---
src
│
├── application → Program execution and menus
