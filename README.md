# JDBC Project

This project was developed as part of my studies in Java Database Connectivity (JDBC).  
It demonstrates a complete CRUD implementation using Java and MySQL, following clean architecture principles.

## Project Goals

- Practice JDBC database connection
- Implement full CRUD operations
- Apply layered architecture (Repository + Service)
- Use PreparedStatement safely
- Handle SQL exceptions properly
- Organize code following SOLID principles

## Technologies Used

- Java 25
- JDBC
- MySQL
- Git & GitHub

## Features

- Insert new records
- Update existing records

- List all records

## How to Run

1. Create a MySQL database as in 'Database'
2. Copy 'db.properties.example' to 'db.properties' and configure your credentials.
3. Run the application

## Concepts Practiced

- JDBC API
- SQL integration
- Layered architecture
- Exception handling
